# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Predicting the car prices By Linear Regression Algorithm

Used Linear regression model and transformed some of the categorical variables to numerical ones using label encoder by which the accuracy has been improved. removed some of the outliers and detected  Using Box plot.
Handled Missing values and Done some exploratory analysis.

After all the steps I received a R-squared of about 90% which is good enough since it has less data around 205 rows and we can use regularization like l1,l2 and other parameters to the model which would impact the model accuracy.
